#IMDB SCORE PREDICTIOR 

Project Overview

Provide a brief overview of the project and its purpose. Explain that the goal is to build a machine learning model that predicts IMDb scores based on specific features. You can mention that IMDb scores are a measure of a movie's popularity and critical reception, and the predictor can be used to estimate the potential score of a movie before its release.





Installation



Imports the necessary libraries:

   - `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis

   - `numpy` for numerical computations

   - `sklearn` for machine learning tasks (train-test split and standard scaling)

   - `plotly.express` for creating interactive visualizations

   - `matplotlib.pyplot` for creating static visualizations

Execution Notes

- Ensure ' NetflixOriginals.csv' ' is available in the specified location for successful execution.

- Update Python and library versions if required for proper functioning

- Reads a CSV file named `NetflixOriginals.csv` using `pandas

-The data is encoded using the 'latin-1' encoding.

Dataset Description

Provide information about the IMDb dataset used in the template. Describe the source of the dataset, its format (CSV, Excel, etc.), and the columns it contains. You can mention the different feature included in the dataset, such as Title, Genre, Premiere, Runtime, IMDB Score, Language .Include a sample of the dataset to give users an idea of its structure.

Dataset

Source:  The dataset 'NetflixOriginals.csv' contains historical movie data from NetflixOriginals from 2014 to 2021

 Description: The dataset comprises columns such as Title, Genre, Premiere, Runtime, IMDB Score, Language

Usage

 Provide step-by-step instructions on how to prepare the dataset, modify the code to fit the specific dataset, and run the code to train the model and make predictions. Include any additional information or considerations, such as data preprocessing steps or model evaluation.

To use this code:

1. Ensure that the necessary libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`, `sklearn`, `plotly`, and `matplotlib`) are installed in your Python environment.

2. Update the file path in the `pd.read_csv()` function to point to the location of your `NetflixOriginals.csv` file.

3. Adjust the test size in the `train_test_split` function if desired.

4. Run the code to load the data, perform data analysis, and split the dataset.

5. Review the printed outputs and visualizations to understand the dataset and the split.

 Results and Evaluation

Describe how to interpret the results and evaluate the performance of the IMDb score predictor. Explain the meaning of metrics like mean squared error (MSE) and how to interpret the values obtained. Provide guidance on how to assess the accuracy and reliability of the predictions made by the model.

Results and Outputs

- Outputs such as cleaned datasets, trained model parameters, and evaluation metrics will be displayed or saved within the respective notebooks.

Sample Output
- (467,5)
- (117,5)
- (467,)
- (117,)



 Future Improvements

  -Explore additional models or deep learning techniques for improved accuracy.

  -Enhance data preprocessing with advanced feature engineering methods.

Additional Notes

- This code assumes that the `NetflixOriginals.csv` file exists in the specified file path and is in the expected format.

- Make sure to modify the code according to your specific use case and requirements.

- Feel free to add more data preprocessing, feature engineering, or machine learning steps as needed.

- Refer to the documentation of the respective libraries for detailed usage instructions and additional functionality.
